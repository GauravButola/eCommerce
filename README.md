This is an eCommerce project I made in C# using ASP.NET and SQL server 2008. I created this project as part of my masters degree.
The project was created rather hastily in around 4-5 days of timespan; so, it might be rough around the edges. Do let me know regarding any updates I should make.
Works best in Google Chrome.
